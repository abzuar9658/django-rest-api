### Using Precommit hooks
- Install pre-commit `brew install pre-commit`
- Run `pre-commit --version` just to check if installed correctly
- Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit on your system
- In case you want to skip pre-commit on a commit do `git commit -nm` instead of `git commit -m`
- Check guide to [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) if need further help!
